# oop_abstraction

Abstraction focuses on hiding the internal implementations of a process or method from the user. In this way, the user knows what he is doing but not how the work is being done.
Using a car as an analogy. We drive without knowing what is going on underneath. We use the breaks to stop the car but we don't know how the breaks work.
Another example is a TV set. We watch films without knowing the inner details of how TV works.
In Python, abstraction is achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces.
